## Local News Scraper

### Overview
An application that scrapes news articles from local news sources to get their title, summary, and the link to the original full-length article. It then saves that information to our Mongo Database and then re-renders them on our page. Users can leave comments on each article, as well as delete comments if they choose, both of which are updated in the database document for that specific article.
