### Local News Scraper

##Overview
An application that scrapes news articles from local news sources to get their title, summary, and the link to the original full-length article, off a local news website. It then saves that information to our Mongo Database and then re-renders them on our page.  Users can leave comments on each article, as well as delete comments if they choose-both of which are updated in the database document for that specific article.
